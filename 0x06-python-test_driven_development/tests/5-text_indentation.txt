Quonam modo?

Utrum igitur tibi litteram videor an totas paginas commovere?

Non autem hoc:

igitur ne illud quidem.

Fortasse id optimum, sed ubi illud:

Plus semper voluptatis?

Teneo, inquit, finem illi videri nihil dolere.

Transfer idem ad modestiam vel temperantiam, quae est moderatio cupiditatum rationi oboediens.

Si id dicis, vicimus.

Inde sermone vario sex illa a Dipylo stadia confecimus.

Sin aliud quid voles, postea.

Quae animi affectio suum cuique tribuens atque hanc, quam dico.

Utinam quidem dicerent alium alio beatiorem! Iam ruinas videres.

Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do:

once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, "and what is the use of a book," thought Alice "without pictures or conversation?
