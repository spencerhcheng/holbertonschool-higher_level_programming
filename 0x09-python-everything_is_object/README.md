## 0x09 PYTHON - Everything is Object


### GOALS
The goals of this project are to better understand the properties of objects in Python; including the differences between a class, object and instance, the difference between immutable object and mutable objects, what a reference is, what an assignment is, and what an alias is.

Additionally, by the completion time of this project, I will have actively explored the situations in which two variables are identical (carry the same value), are linked to the same object.

Learning the difference between "is not" and "!=" or "is" and "==".

What types are mutable and which are not?
