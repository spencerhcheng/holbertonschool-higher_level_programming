>>> Square = __import__('4-square').Square

Expected Successes:
===================

# size is int
>>> my_square = Square(9)
>>> print("Area: {} for size: {}".format(my_square.area(), my_square.size))
Area: 81 for size: 9

# size is large int
>>> my_square = Square(100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000)
>>> print("Area: {} for size: {}".format(my_square.area(), my_square.size))
Area: 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 for size: 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

# no size passed
>>> my_square = Square()
>>> print("Area: {} for size: {}".format(my_square.area(), my_square.size))
Area: 0 for size: 0

Expected Failures:
==================

# size is not int
>>> my_square = Square("size")
Traceback (most recent call last)
        ...
TypeError: size must be an integer

# size is negative
>>> my_square = Square(-17)
Traceback (most recent call last)
        ...
ValueError: size must be >= 0
