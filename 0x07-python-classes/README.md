## 0x07 PYTHON - CLASSES & OBJECTS

### GOALS
Get acquainted with classes and objects in python. Learn the difference between a class and an object or an instance. What is an attribute, what are and how to use public, protected and private attributes. What is self, a method, __init__, data abstraction, data encapsulation, information hiding, property, the difference between an attribute and a property in Python.

### SPECIFICATIONS
Tests are located in the tests folder with the extension `.txt.` Code follows PEP 8 Style protocol. All files are compiled using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3.

#### 0. My first square
An empty class `Square` that defines a square.

#### 1. Square with a size
A class `Square` that defines a square with a private instance attribute: `size`, instantiation with `size`.

#### 2. Size validation
A class `Square` that defines a square. `size` must be an integer, otherwise raises a `TypeError` exception `size must be an integer`. If the `size` is less than `0`, the `ValueError` exception is raised with the message `size must be >= 0`.

#### 3. Area of a square
A class `Square` that defines a square. `size
` must be an integer, otherwise raises a `Typ
eError` exception `size must be an integer`. If the `size` is less than `0`, the `ValueErr
or` exception is raised with the message `siz
e must be >= 0`. The public instance method: `def area(self):` returns the square's area.

#### 4. Access and update private attribute
A class `Square` that defines a square. `size
` must be an integer, otherwise raises a `Typ
eError` exception `size must be an integer`. If the `size` is less than `0`, the `ValueErr
or` exception is raised with the message `siz
e must be >= 0`. The public instance method: `def area(self):` returns the square's area.

#### 5. Printing a square
A class `Square` that prints a square composed of `#`(hashtags. `size
` must be an integer, otherwise raises a `Typ
eError` exception `size must be an integer`. If the `size` is less than `0`, the `ValueErr
or` exception is raised with the message `siz
e must be >= 0`. The public instance method: `def area(self):` returns the square's area.

#### 6. Coordinates of a square
A class `Square` that defines a square and prints a square composed of `#` based on its `position`. `size
` must be an integer, otherwise raises a `Typ
eError` exception `size must be an integer`. If the `size` is less than `0`, the `ValueErr
or` exception is raised with the message `siz
e must be >= 0`. The public instance method: `def area(self):` returns the square's area. The private instance attribute, `position` is set and retrieved. `position` is a tuple denoting x and y values to print out horizontal spaces and new lines respectively.
